## Description

    This is a basic example of a Svelvet graph. Svelvet has endless usecases, one of which could

    be a database visualization tool. Below you can see 11[Nodes](../components/node) that depict the

    relationships between different SQL tables. Notice that you can manually connect and disconnect

    the tables from one to another via the [Anchors](../components/anchor) points. Upon a connection,

    an [Edge](../components/edge) is also rendered.
